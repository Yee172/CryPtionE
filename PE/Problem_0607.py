# Frodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from
# point A to point B. On normal terrain, they can cover
# 10 leagues per day, and so the journey would take 10 days.
# However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which
# runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking
# through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50
# leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is
# located in the middle of the marsh.
# The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues
# across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip
# closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can
# be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However,
# each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate,
# the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues
# per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends
# and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed
# going back to 10 leagues per day.
# If Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B,
# they would travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey
# would take approximately 13.4738 days. However, this
# time can be shortened if they deviate from the direct path.
# Find the shortest possible time required to travel from
# point A to B, and give your answer in days, rounded to
# 10 decimal places.

# Analysis: ternary search
#           Hint: write down the travel time formula according to
#                 the angle of marching routine in each region,
#                 then partial derivative it
