# Consider an n-player game played in consecutive pairs:
# Round 1 takes place between players 1 and 2, round 2
# takes place between players 2 and 3, and so on and so
# forth, all the way up to round n, which takes place
# between players n and 1. Then round n + 1 takes place
# between players 1 and 2 as the entire cycle starts again.
# In other words, during round r, player ((r âˆ’ 1) mod n) + 1
# faces off against player (r mod n) + 1.
# During each round, a fair coin is tossed to decide which
# of the two players wins that round. If any given player
# wins both rounds r and r + 1, then that player wins the
# entire game.
# Let P_{n}(k) be the probability that player k wins in
# an n-player game, in the form of a reduced fraction.
# Let M_{n}(k) be the product of the reduced numerator
# and denominator of P_{n}(k).
# Find the last 8 digits of M_{10^{8} + 7}(10^{4} + 7).
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Analysis: brute force
#           Hint: draw a possibility tree, then we can conclude that
#                 P_{n}(k) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \frac{k + i * n - 1}{2^{k + i * n}}
#                          = \frac{2^{n - k} * ((k - 1) * (2^{n} - 1) + n)}{(2^{n} - 1)^{2}}
