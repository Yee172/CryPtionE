# Turan has the electrical water heating system outside
# his house in a shed. The electrical system uses two
# fuses in series, one in the house and one in the shed.
# (Nowadays old fashioned fuses are often replaced with
# reusable mini circuit breakers, but Turan's system still
# uses old fashioned fuses.) For the heating system to
# work both fuses must work.
# Turan has N fuses. He knows that m of them are working
# and the rest are blown. However, he doesn't know which
# ones are blown. So he tries different combinations until
# the heating system turns on.
# We denote by T(N, m) the smallest number of tries required
# to ensure the heating system turns on.
# Let L(N) be the sum of all T(N, m) for 2 \leq m \leq N.
# Find L(10^{7}).
