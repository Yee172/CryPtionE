# A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc.
# In a game of chance a player takes a disc at random
# and its colour is noted. After each turn the disc is
# returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and
# another disc is taken at random.
# The player pays £1 to play and wins if they have taken
# more blue discs than red discs at the end of the game.
# If the game is played for four turns, the probability
# of a player winning is exactly 11 / 120, and so the
# maximum prize fund the banker should allocate for winning
# in this game would be £10 before they would expect to
# incur a loss.
# Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated
# to a single game in which fifteen turns are played.
