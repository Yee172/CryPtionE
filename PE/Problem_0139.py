# Let (a, b, c) represent the three sides of a right angle
# triangle with integral length sides. It is possible to
# place four such triangles together to form a square with
# length c.
# For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together
# to form a 5 by 5 square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle
# and it can be seen that the 5 by 5 square can be tiled
# with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.
# However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the
# hole would measure 7 by 7 and these could not be used
# to tile the 13 by 13 square.
# Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less
# than one-hundred million, how many Pythagorean triangles
# would allow such a tiling to take place?
