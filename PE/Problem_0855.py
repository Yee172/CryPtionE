# Given two positive integers a, b, Alex and Bianca play
# a game in (a b) rounds. They begin with a square piece
# of paper of side length 1.
# In each round Alex divides the current rectangular piece
# of paper into a \times b pieces using a - 1 horizontal
# cuts and b - 1 vertical ones. The cuts do not need to be
# evenly spaced. Moreover, a piece can have zero width / height
# when a cut coincides with another cut or the edge of
# the paper. The pieces are then numbered 1, 2, ..., a b
# starting from the left top corner, moving from left to
# right and starting from the left of the next row when
# a row is finished.
# Then Bianca chooses one of the pieces for the game to
# continue on. However, Bianca must not choose a piece
# with a number she has already chosen during the game.
# Bianca wants to minimize the area of the final piece
# of paper while Alex wants to maximize it. Let S(a, b)
# be the area of the final piece assuming optimal play.
# Find S(5, 8). Give your answer in scientific notation
# rounded to ten significant digits after the decimal
# point. Use a lowercase e to separate the mantissa and
# the exponent.
