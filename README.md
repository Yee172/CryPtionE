# CryPtionE
### Cryption PE

I use this repo to record my PE solutions, and share code with my friends.

In order not to undermine the experience of others, I only posted my **encrypted solutions** for PE problems and my public key for this repo. However, [a useful module library](./PE/lib) is open.

The solutions are encrypted with **RSA**, and if you want to see my solutions (get the private key for decryption), please contact me in person or email me.

Email address: <yee_172@163.com>

Please write the email subject as "Require the private key of CryPtionE".

#### Requirement:

Python3 package `pycryptodome`.

#### Instruction:

Just use `RUNME.sh` to start.

`private_key` should put in the same folder of `public_key`.
